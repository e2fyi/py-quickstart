# {{cookiecutter.package_name}}

`{{cookiecutter.package_name}}` is a python package with the namespace `{{cookiecutter.namespace}}`.

## Developer guide

This project used:

- isort: to manage import order
- pylint: to manage general coding best practices
- flake8: to manage code complexity and coding best practices
- black: to manage formats and styles
- pydocstyle: to manage docstr style/format
- pytest/coverage: to manage unit tests and code coverage
- bandit: to find common security issues
- pyenv: to manage dev env: python version ({{cookiecutter.python_version}})
- pipenv: to manage dev env: python packages

Convention for unit tests are to suffix with `_test` and colocate with the actual
python module - i.e. `<module_name>_test.py`.

The version of the package is read from `version.txt` - i.e. please update the
appropriate semantic version (major -> breaking changes, minor -> new features, patch -> bug fix, postfix -> pre-release/post-release).
